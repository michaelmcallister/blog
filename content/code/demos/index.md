Below is a small collection of graphical demos that I've written using the [Ebiten](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) framework.

Currently it's just a water ripple effect, but I plan to write more over the coming months. Particularly 2D old school demoscene effects that I come across on the internet.
