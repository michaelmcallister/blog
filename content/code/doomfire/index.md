The below fire effect was doing the rounds on HackerNews and I thought I'd have 
a go at implementing it myself based on on the well documented [write up](https://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/) by Fabien Sanglard.

It's exceptionally easy, and relies on a judicious use of 37 different colours, ranging from coldest to hottest.
